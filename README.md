### Disclaimer

- I didn't want to handle the setup and boilerplate so I took the first thing I found and used it. It's a yeoman generator, it works nicely but all dependencies are outdated.
- PR most welcome! Don't be afraid :)

### What does it do

- It adds an icon next to the other extensions' icons.
- Clicking it lets you add the names of the repo you'd like to filter..

### Next steps

- Any ideas? Open an issue!
